Anzaker, a hacking multi-tool made in Python 3.10 by Anz!

I will keep updating this tool, so I will always be fixing any bugs, add new tools here etc.
I have tested this tool on all operating systems and it works well and same on all operating systems.
This is a proper multi-tool so you can keep going back and forth using all the tools like a normal GUI software.

If there is any bug or issue then go to issues and post there.

DISCLAIMER: I am not responsible with your illegal intentions with this so please don't use this on someone explicitly without their permission.

# What does it do?

This hacking multi-tool does a lot of stuff revolved around hacking, OSINT & more!

- Port Scanner
- SSH Bruteforce
- Vulnerability Scanner
- FTP Anonymous Login
- Get Information of an IP Address
- Arp Spoofer
- Password Sniffer
- Get Information on a Phone Number
- Password Cracker
- Email Scraper

I will keep adding new tools to this multi-tool!

NOTE: 
- Currently the SSH Bruteforce is a big buggy right now so I am trying to fix it however it works fast and sort of well
- Vulnerability Scanner isn't fully finished yet, there is still some pending vulnerable banners I need to add so I am working on that
- The Password Sniffer doesn't sniff passwords from the target so I am gonna make that you can steal credentials from the target since it only sniffs on the machine you run this on
